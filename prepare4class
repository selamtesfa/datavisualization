Teaching to See
Inge Druckrey 


* “Graphic design is seeing and envisioning”
* Give your time to stare at the artwork to really see - the elements are important minor details that may be overlooked but play a significant role in the overall art
* You become visually aaware when you pay attention to texture
* Dots are a flexible element - many  different possibilities 
* Classical roman letter is the ancestor of all later former development of our alphabet 
* There is a contrast between the letters “S” and “L”
* The notion of the large G and curves of the S creates a contrast of motion
* There is effort put in when writing out the alphabet - curve needing to be refined, height needing to be aligned, all standing on the same baseline.
* The “V’ is actually not an easy letter to design. 
* Space inside and in between the characters needs to be the same space (area of the space) - you have to learn to do by eye
* A good type space should have letters that share a common structure, letters that are sufficiently distinct from each other, and good proper optical letter spacing.
* The lightest colors are the ones closest to white
* “Good survey maps integrate good layers”
* “Detail type and symbols survive bc landscape features are kept very light”
* Brightness if he full saturation of the color - definition as bluest blue or reddest red
* Color can be talked about as a grey value
